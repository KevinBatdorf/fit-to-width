## Fit to Width

A WordPress block that automatically adjusts the text to fit the width of its container. CSS only.

> [!CAUTION]
> Currently this block will not meet SC 1.4.4 (Resize Text). I'm currently looking into ways to address this responsibly.

For a detailed explanation of how this works, see [https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width](https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width).

### Features
